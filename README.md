# Digital_Image_Watermarking_Entropy_DCT_DWT
A technique for embedding one mark or image within another using Entropy as a discriminant to identify the most strategic points of the image, DCT and DWT transforms are also used for insertion, the method is designed to be robust against jpeg compressions.
The work is not based on any specific paper other than the study of information theory and images.
